# Purpose of Notebook

Convert my data structures into the format that Aijin makes from her states.

# Setup

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
meta = read_csv("../Data/meta_2020-05-10.csv")
```

## Observations

Column names:

- state_name	
- Link	
- total.tested	
- total.case	
- total.tested.today	
- total.positive.today	
- total.death.today	
- positive_race	
- positive_age	
- positive_gender	
- positivity.rate	
- county.details	
- total.death	
- death_race	
- death_age	
- death_gender	
- comorbidities	
- total_hosp	
- hosp_race	
- hosp_age	
- hosp_gender	
- platform	
- comments	
- last.update

- presence of nested datasets (ie age, race breakdowns) -> list-cols
- maybe an .Rda/.Rdata file would be better for this?

# Plan:

Just change all of my `get_*` functions to produce a row that matches Aijin's format, then compile it with one function.

```{r}
compile = function() {
  
}
```
